# Vue - Netlify - Fauna Starter Kit

A [JAM stack](https://jamstack.org/) template which uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for the front-end, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for APIs (via Netlify Functions) and [Fauna](https://www.netlify.com/) for the database. 

This is an entirely serverless stack which leans heavily on Netlify and Fauna for the backend. At the time of writing this, these services offer generous free tiers which means anyone can get started and deploy and host this completely free.
